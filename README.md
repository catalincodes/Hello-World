# Hello-World

Hi everyone,

My name is Catalin. I like programming in C++ and Java. I have started programming since I was very young using BASIC. 
I am currently a student in Computer Engineering at Ecole Polytechnique de Montreal, in my 2nd year.

I look forward to seeing where my path will take me.
